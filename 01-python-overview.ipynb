    "# Python Features\n",
    "- easy to learn\n",
    "  - simple syntax\n",
    "  - concise notation for common tasks\n",
    "- basic data structures are built into the language\n",
    "+ interactive \n",
    "    - interpreted, not compiled(usually)\n",
    "    - read-eval-print-loop(repl)\n",
    "    - easy to play with things\n",
    "- no type declarations on variables\n",
    "  + expedites experiments and prototyping\n",
    "  + but there's a downside \n",
    "      - lose compiler error checking\n",
    "      - A python program can have all kinds of bugs that \n",
    "      are impossible in Java/C++\n",
    "      - Errors are detected at run type - program can bomb unexpectedly \n",
    "      + harder for humans to understand code\n",
    "      + many optimizations that compilers do are not possible\n",
    "      + slower than Java or C++ at some tasks\n",
    "+ multi-paradigm: supports procedural, object oriented, and functional programming\n",
    "+ exceedingly popular in research environments like Columbia\n",
    "- out in the 'real world' C, C++, and Java probably more popular\n",
    "    - [programming language survey](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index)\n",
    "+ Python is pulling together many great ideas from other languages, including\n",
    "  * Lisp\n",
    "  * Matlab\n",
    "  * R\n",
    "  * Mathematica\n",
    "- huge number of 3rd party libraries\n",

    "# Which Version of the Python Language?\n",
    "- Python painted itself into a bit of a corner several years ago\n",
    "  - decided to fix a number of problems with 2.7 version\n",
    "  - fixes became version 3.X, but 3.X is incompatible with 2.7\n",
    "  - for several years many people refused to use 3.X, but the tide\n",
    "  seems to have turned\n",
    "- we will use 3.5 - quite a bit cleaner than 2.7\n",
    "- We will briefly discuss strategies for dealing with 2.7 if required\n",
    "\n",
    "# Which Implementation of Python?\n",
    "- We will use the \"standard\" CPython\n",
    "    - included in the download from Anaconda\n",
    "- There are special purpose implementations we will discuss later\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ways to Run Python\n",
    "  - interactive interpreter\n",
    "      - \"vanilla\" python\n",
    "      - ipython\n",
    "          - recommended\n",
    "          - time saving help features\n",
    "      - ipython notebooks\n",
    "          - to run the notebooks i distribute, cd to the directory the notebooks are in, and enter 'ipython notebook'\n",
    "          - a tab will appear in your browser with the notebook files\n",
    "          - click on a file to open it in a new tab\n",
    "  - python programs can be invoked and run without user interaction(scripts)\n",
    "      - much nicer than bash\n",
    "      - computeCp\n",
    "      - pbackup\n",
    "  - as a server\n",
    "      - flask\n",
    "      - django\n",
    "  - can be embedded into other programs\n",
    "      - blender\n",
    "         - running line below will move a vertex of the default cube\n",
    "         - bpy.data.objects[\"Cube\"].data.vertices[0].co.x += 1.0\n",
    "  - inside an IDE\n",
    "    - spyder(recommended)\n",
    "        - in your home dir, open anaconda/bin/spyder to start it\n",
    "        - be patient, it takes a while to come up\n",
    "        - in preferences/object inspector/automatic connections, \n",
    "        turn on \"editor\", \"python console\" \"ipython\". this enables help while you type\n",
    "    - eclipse\n",
    "        - has a python mode, but I find it difficult to use\n",

    "# Python Memory Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Everything is an Object\n",
    "- objects have a type, state(instance variables), and execute\n",
    "procedures(methods) which may reference and modify the object's\n",
    "state\n",
    "+ unlike Java and C++, which also have immediates(unboxed)\n",
    "+ Python model is simple and elegant, but incurs considerable memory overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "### All objects are stored in the heap\n",
    "+ no allocation on the stack\n",
    "+ automatic memory management via reference counting\n",
    "  - when no references to an object are left, the object's memory is reclaimed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects are mutable or immutable\n",
    "+ the state of a mutable object can be modified at any time\n",
    "    - example: list\n",
    "+ immutable objects can not be modified after creation\n",
    "    - example: string\n",
    "    - functional programming favors immutables\n",
    "- the type of an object never changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory is not directly accessible\n",
    "+ no pointers to memory locations\n",
    "    - like Java\n",
    "    - unlike C/C++\n",
    "    - no 'pointer arithmetic'\n",
    "+ variables only hold 'references' to objects\n",
    "- in theory, not possible to corrupt memory and crash, unlike C/C++\n",
